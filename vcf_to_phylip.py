# This python script coverts vcf files into phylip format

# Modules 

# Set up temporary files for data to be pushed into 

def VCF_parser(vcf_file_name)
	# Obtain and open VCF file 

	# Take the VCF file and skip over the metadata 
	# Take the 9th row+ and make an array called "Sample_Names"
	# Figure out how many samples there are in the file (max) 

	# Find the total length of the genome sequences 

	# Make an array of all of the reference alleles (in row 3)
	# Make an array of all of the alternative alleles (in row 4)

	# Make an array for the genotypes

	# Push into temporary files

def phylip_format(sequences)
	# Create a dictionary and push information 
	# Print sample name 
	# Print sequence 

# Create an if statement that executes both functions and then closes 
# the temporary files
